Here’s a new README.md draft tailored to your current ClubOS V2.0 build — acknowledging your architecture, priorities, and modular design stack.

⸻

🧠 ClubOS Mission Control v2.0

Cognitive command layer for Clubhouse 24/7 Golf — built for autonomous facility infrastructure, not just operations. This is the execution nervous system for tasks, SOPs, ticketing, and LLM routing — with layered control, dry logic, and zero-friction UI.

⸻

⛓️ SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Layer	Description
ClubCore	Core engine — task parsing, routing, DB logic
ClubOps	SOP processor — muscle memory logic
SignalOS	Strategic simulation engine (for recursion, testing, fallback chains)
Clubhost	Tone enforcement (dry, sharp, human-clone wrapper)
CapabilityFrontier	Guardrails — escalate on fail, alert on hallucination
Ticket Engine	Issue tracker — logs all post-processed output, failure states, and actionables
Drive Search	Google Drive vector-backed retrieval layer for SOPs and documents
UI Layer	HTML/JS-based Command Center — one-click task injection and monitoring

🧪 API ENDPOINTS

Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/health	Heartbeat ping for frontend check
POST	/process	Main request intake — routes to appropriate engine layers
POST	/ticket	Manual ticket creation
GET	/sop/search	(Planned) Google Drive vector search endpoint


⸻

⚙️ SETUP
	1.	Install deps

pip install -r requirements.txt


	2.	Run server

uvicorn backend.main:app --reload


	3.	Access UI
Open frontend/index.html in browser (runs entirely client-side, uses API at localhost/api)

⸻

🧠 TECH STACK

Component	Use
FastAPI	Backend + routing
SQLAlchemy	Task + Ticket DB
OpenAI API	Prompt execution
Google Drive (planned)	SOP + document search
Pydantic	Validation
HTML/JS	Command Console UI


⸻

🧩 LLM LOGIC LAYERS

Each processed request can trigger any or all of these:
	1.	CapabilityFrontier: Should the LLM even handle this?
	2.	ClubOps: Is this procedural? Route to SOP.
	3.	SignalOS: Need strategic simulation?
	4.	Clubhost: Reformat output into house tone.
	5.	TicketEngine: Log output, trigger escalation if failure/conflict detected.

⸻

🧰 COMMAND CENTER

In the frontend UI, available commands:

install           → Bay install protocol logic
rewrite           → Force tone layer
simulate          → Run strategy simulation
ad                → Brand-compliant promo gen
cleaner_sop       → Standard cleaning routine v2.0

Toggle flags: simulate, escalate, generate ticket, use LLM, Drive search.

⸻

🧱 TO ADD NEXT
	•	✅ Google Drive vector index
	•	✅ Auth + role logic
	•	⏳ Inline document preview on SOP search
	•	⏳ Mobile-friendly dashboard
	•	⏳ Auto-escalation to external ticket systems (e.g. Linear)

⸻

Let me know if you want a docs/ folder scaffold for dev handoff, or Dockerfile to encapsulate this whole stack.
