ClubOS Internal Architecture Update
Version: July 2025 | For Implementation: Pearson-Ready

🔄 Naming Conflict Resolution
Previous Issue: "ClubOS" was being used both as the name of the overall cognitive engine and as a specific internal layer responsible for procedural ops logic.
Solution:
Promote ClubOS to refer exclusively to the entire master system.
Rename the previous "ClubOS layer" to ClubOps.
All internal files, documentation, routing logic, and interfaces are now updated accordingly.

📊 Updated Module Map
All modules are callable via prefix signals in interface or prompts (e.g. install, rewrite, simulate, ad).

🔠 Analogy: ClubOS as the Nervous System

✅ Implementation Status
 UI references updated
 Internal docs cascaded
 Prompt engine logic renamed
 Live files updated
 Escalation rules re-mapped to new module labels
 Ticket engine positioned at post-processing layer, not within UI logic

## 🔁 Upgrade Path to Full Unified Cognitive Engine

When you're ready to switch to the advanced version:

1. Replace the backend entrypoint:
    ```python
    # From:
    from engine import OperationalEngine

    # To:
    from unified_engine import UnifiedCognitiveEngine
    ```

2. Update FastAPI routes to match the `/process` handler from the full engine.

3. Add these modules:
    - `unified_engine.py` (core logic)
    - `unified_models.py` (dataclasses and enums)
    - `version_manager.py`, `monitoring.py`, `webhooks.py` (optional utilities)

4. Unified Engine includes:
    - Versioning & rollback
    - Constraint enforcement (pricing caps, SOP versions, etc.)
    - Layered cognitive flow (ClubOps → SignalOS → Clubhost → CapabilityFrontier)
    - Ticket Engine at post-processing layer
    - Full DB trace with cognitive_layers and context blocks

5. The UI is already compatible — toggles like "Use LLM", "Require Simulation", and "Generate Ticket" will be respected.

Recommended only if you're ready to maintain a more modular system.
